GeoJson

1. GeoJson is supported by MongoDB
2. The geometrywhich we get from mapbox API is GeoJson which helps us to add many methods provided by mongo on it
3. For GeoJson we need to change the schema 


const campgrounds={features : <%-JSON.stringify(campgrounds)%>}

we have addedthe features here becausr the cluster map will always look for the features object while displaying

VIRTUAL - PROPERTIES

since while displaying a message /popup when we click on a unclustered point on the cluster map we require a message that should be in the 
'properties' object. So create a virtual of properties and add a link that displays a information about particular campground in that virtual


const opts = { toJSON: { virtuals: true } };

By default, Mongoose does not include virtuals when you convert a document to JSON. For example, if you pass a document to Express' res.json() function, virtuals will not be included by default.
To include virtuals in res.json(), you need to set the toJSON schema option to { virtuals: true }.
since we are converting campgrounds to json we need to add this sentence in models to access 'properties.popUpMessage' in clusterMap.js
